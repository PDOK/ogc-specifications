## Table 3 - WFS exception codes

| exceptionCode values | Meaning of code | "locator" value | Conformance Class |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CannotLockAllFeatures | A locking request with a lockAction of ALL failed to lock all the requested features. | If the operation includes the optional "handle" parameter, report its value as the value of the "location" parameter. | Locking WFS |
| DuplicateStoredQueryIdValue | The identifier specified for a stored query expression is a duplicate. | The "locator" parameter shall contain the value of the duplicate identifier. | Manage stored queries |
| DuplicateStoredQueryParameterName | This specified name for a stored query parameter is already being used within the same stored query definition. | The "locator" parameter shall list the name of the duplicate stored query parameter. | Manage stored queries |
| FeaturesNotLocked | For servers that do not support automatic data locking (see 15.2.3.1), this exception indicates that a transaction operation is modifying features that have not previously been locked using a LockFeature (see Clause 12) or GetFeatureWithLock (see Clause 13) operation. | If the operation includes the optional "handle" parameter report its value as the value of the "location" parameter. | Locking WFS |
| InvalidLockId | The value of the lockId parameter on a Transaction operation is invalid because it was not generated by the server. | The "locator" parameter shall contain the value of the invalid lockId. | Locking WFS |
| InvalidValue | A Transaction (see Clause 15) has attempted to insert or change the value of a data component in a way that violates the schema of the feature. | The "locator" parameter shall contain the name of the property being incorrectly modified. | Transactional WFS |
| LockHasExpired | The specified lock identifier on a Transaction or LockFeature operation has expired and is no longer valid. | The "locator" parameter shall contain the value of the expired lock identifier. | Locking WFS |
| OperationParsingFailed | The request is badly formed and failed to be parsed by the server. | The "locator" parameter shall contain the value of the "handle" parameter if one is available. Otherwise the "locator" parameter shall contain the name of the badly formed operation. | All (see Table 1) |
| OperationProcessingFailed |  An error was encountered while processing the operation. | The "locator" parameter shall contain the value of the "handle" parameter if one is available. Otherwise the "locator" parameter shall contain the name of the operation that failed. | All (see Table 1) |
| ResponseCacheExpired | The response cache used to support paging has expired and the results are no longer available. | If the operation includes the optional "handle" parameter, report its value as the value of the "locator" parameter. | Response paging |
